    <h2>Conversations.im Summer of Code 2018</h2>
    <p class="lead">Conversations started out as an easy to use Jabber client for the Android platform but quickly became an umbrella project for all sorts of UX improvements to the XMPP ecosystem.</p>
    <h3>Getting involved</h3>
    <p>Conversations puts a lot of focus on <em>user experience</em> so we encourage you to become a <em>user</em> of XMPP first.<br>To become a user you need to:</p>
      <ol>
        <li>Download an XMPP client (<a href="https://conversations.im">Conversations</a><sup><small>1</small></sup> on Android and <a href="https://gajim.org">Gajim</a> on Windows and Linux)</li>
        <li>Create an account on an XMPP server. For startes we recommend creating an account on the <em>conversations.im</em> server. In both Gajim and Conversations you can tick the checkbox <em>Create new account</em> during initial setup.</li>
      </ol>
    <p>After downloading a client and creating an account please join the conversations group chat (MUC) under the address: <a href="xmpp:gsoc@conference.conversations.im?join">xmpp:gsoc@conference.conversations.im?join</a>.</p>
    <p><sup><small>1</small></sup> Conversations is not available for free on the PlayStore. However we wouldn’t ask potential applicants to buy the application. Instead either sideload it from the Open Source App Store <a href="https://f-droid.org/repository/browse%20/?fdid=eu.siacs.conversations">F-Droid</a>, build it <a href="https://github.com/siacs/Conversations">from source</a> or join with a different client first and ask for a promo code in the GSoC group chat, that will allow you to install the app for free from the Google PlayStore.</p>
    <h3>Project Ideas</h3>
    <p class="lead">Keep in mind that the following project ideas are just <em>ideas</em>. In general we are interested in anything that has the ability to improve the UX for end users and newcomers to XMPP. This doesn’t necessarily have to involve client development but can also be about aiding the user to pick the right server or about contact discovery.</p>
    <h4>Turn Compliance Tester into Webservice</h4>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Software Project:</strong> XMPP Compliance Tester</li>
      <li><strong>Software URL:</strong> <a href="https://conversations.im/compliance">conversations.im/compliance/</a></li>
      <li><strong>Software VCS:</strong> <a href="https://github.com/iNPUTmice/ComplianceTester">github.com/iNPUTmice/ComplianceTester</a></li>
      <li><strong>Software Description:</strong> A tool totest XMPP servers for compatibility with various compliance suites.</li>
      <li><strong>Brief explanation:</strong> Adding a server to the compliance tester overview is a rather complicated task. A server admin (or interested user) has to download the Compliance Tester, run it, and submit the result as a pull request on github. Afterwards a series of hacked together scripts will evaluate those results and create the overview page. This Google Summer of Code project is to create a webservice that will run the test automatially in certain intervals, store the test results in a database and dynamically create the overview page from that database.</li>
      <li><strong>Required skills: </strong> Java, HTML, Basic XMPP knowledge</li>
      <li><strong>Implementation Language:</strong> Java 8, Babbler XMPP library</li>

            <li><strong>Software Description</strong> Conversations is a state of the art mobile instant messaging client for Android. It provides a modern user experience and is on top of the current developments in XMPP standards.</li>
            <li><strong>Brief explanation:</strong> The ability to make voice and video calls is by far the most requested feature for Conversations. With Jingle there is a standard extension in XMPP to negoitate P2P audio and video sessions. Implementing video calls faces many challanges. Not only network and bandwidth wise but also UX wise.<br>Quite frankly this is a rather challenging project. We aim to actually merge the code that comes out of GSoC and we can't merge the code if the UX is bad (either because of too many edge case where it simply doesn’t work or because it looks terrible.)</li>
            <li><strong>Expected results:</strong>
                    <ul>
                            <li>Make libwebrtc build in Conversations</li>
                            <li>Setup some basic A/V calls between two Conversations clients</li>
                            <li>Translate the SDP output of libwrtc to Jingle syntax</li>
                            <li>(Re)negoitae the session on network switches or screen rotations</li>
                            <li>Implement a great accept call and call UI</li>
                </ul>
        </li>
        <li><strong>Difficulty:</strong> Very hard</li>

  <li><strong>Software Description</strong> Smack is a highly modular and portable open source XMPP client library written in Java for Android and Java (SE) VMs.</li>
  <li><strong>Brief
  explanation:</strong> <a href="https://xmpp.org/extensions/xep-0390.html">Entity
  Capabilities 2.0 (XEP-0390)</a> is an overhaul
  of <a href="https://xmpp.org/extensions/xep-0115.html">Entity
  Capabilities (XEP-0115)</a>, which provides an efficient way for
  remote entities to signal their capabilities. This mechanism reduces
  network traffic and speeds up most other protocols. In order to add
  support for XEP-0390, the existing ServcieDiscoveryManger code must
  be extended to support for plugable remote entity feature discovery
  mechanisms.
  <li><strong>Expected results:</strong>
	<ul>
	  <li>Support for Entity Capabilities 2.0.</li>
	  <li>Extending the existing Service Discovery code to allow for plugable feature-cache mechanisms.</li>

  <li><strong>Software Description</strong> Smack is a highly modular and portable open source XMPP client library written in Java for Android and Java (SE) VMs.</li>
  <li><strong>Brief explanation:</strong> WebSockets
  (<a href="https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc6455">RFC 6455</a>) are an
  alternative way to establish a connection between a server and a
  client. This project idea is about adding support
  for <a href="https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc7395">XMPP over
  WebSocket (RFC 7395)</a> to Smack. The student needs to implement
  a new `XMPPWebSocketConnection` which extends the existing
  `XMPPConnection` interface. The resulting API must be compatible to
  the existing Smack code and must also be usable on Android
  devices.</li>
  <li><strong>Expected results:</strong>
	<ul>
	  <li>Being able to connect to XMPP services via WebSocket.</li>
	  <li>Definition of a WebSocket interface on top of the used
	  WebSocket libraries, allowing for differeet WebSocket
	  implementations.</li>

<h4>Dino: OMEMO improvements</h4>
<ul>
  <li><strong>Software Project:</strong> Dino</li>
  <li><strong>Software URL:</strong> <a href="https://dino.im">https://dino.im</a></li>
  <li><strong>Software VCS URL:</strong> <a href="https://github.com/dino/dino">https://github.com/dino/dino</a></li>
  <li><strong>Software Description</strong> Dino is a open-source chat client for the desktop. It aims to provide a clean user interface, reliable Jabber/XMPP experience and modern features while having the users privacy in mind.</li>
  <li><strong>Brief explanation:</strong> The OMEMO encryption protocol allows to have forward-secret encrypted chats with multiple parties/devices on the XMPP network. Dino already includes a basic implementation of OMEMO, currently supporting simple encrypted two-person chats. However our OMEMO implementation lacks support for groupchats and still requires proper ways to verify keys of other users and manage trust in user keys. We'd like to use the "Blind trust before verification" model by default, with possibility to entirely disable blind trust for the paranoid.</li>

  <li><strong>Expected results:</strong>
      <ul>
          <li>Allow to verify your own devices and keys of other users, maintain trust in local database.</li>
          <li>Implement "Blind trust before Verification"</li>
          <li>Notify the user about new own devices, asking for verification</li>
          <li>Show message in conversation with user when they add a new device. Ask for verification if required.</li>

  <li><strong>Software Description</strong> Dino is a open-source chat client for the desktop. It aims to provide a clean user interface, reliable Jabber/XMPP experience and modern features while having the users privacy in mind.</li>
  <li><strong>Brief explanation:</strong> Dino displays messages as they come in and allows to go back in time as a user scrolls up. However, there is no way to search through messages. This project should add a UI to quickly and intuitively search through locally stored messages with the possibility to view the context of a result.</li>
  <li><strong>Expected results:</strong>
      <ul>
          <li>Intuitive UI for searching through messages</li>
          <li>Possibility to explore the context of a search result</li>
          <li>Performant search</li>

<h4>Dino: On-boarding experience</h4>
<ul>
  <li><strong>Software Project:</strong> Dino</li>

  <li><strong>Software VCS URL:</strong> <a href="https://github.com/dino/dino">https://github.com/dino/dino</a></li>
  <li><strong>Software Description</strong> Dino is a open-source chat client for the desktop. It aims to provide a clean user interface, reliable Jabber/XMPP experience and modern features while having the users privacy in mind.</li>
  <li><strong>Brief explanation:</strong> When a user first starts Dino, they get to a screen informing them that there are no accounts, they can then get to a window that offers to add an account and then to a window where they can enter their JID and password. This procedure is neither fast, nor intuitive, nor does it handle errors or provide advanced options. The goal of this project is to rework the on-boarding experience. A student doing the project will have to design a viable user experience and decide about relevant features and how to present them. A student may extend this project by considering an XMPP easy-onboarding process.</li>

  <li><strong>Software VCS URL:</strong> <a href="https://github.com/dino/dino">https://github.com/dino/dino</a></li>
  <li><strong>Software Description</strong> Dino is a open-source chat client for the desktop. It aims to provide a clean user interface, reliable Jabber/XMPP experience and modern features while having the users privacy in mind.</li>
  <li><strong>Brief explanation:</strong> Real-time text is text transmitted instantly while it is being typed or created. The recipient can immediately read the sender's text as it is written, without waiting. It allows text to be used as conversationally as a telephone conversation, including in situations where speech is not practical (e.g., environments that must be quiet, environments too noisy to hear, restrictions on phone use, situations where speaking is a privacy or security concern, and/or when participant(s) are deaf or hard of hearing).</li>
